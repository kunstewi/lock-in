### 1. What is a Database?

A **database** is an organized collection of related data stored electronically so that it can be **easily accessed, managed, and updated**.
It stores data in a structured way (tables, rows, columns, etc.) to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency.

**Example:**
A college database storing students’ names, roll numbers, courses, and marks.

### 2. Difference between Database and DBMS

| Database                                | DBMS (Database Management System)                    |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| It is the **actual collection of data** | It is **software** used to manage the database       |
| Stores information only                 | Creates, stores, updates, deletes, and controls data |
| Cannot operate by itself                | Acts as an interface between user and database       |
| Passive (just data)                     | Active (controls and manages data)                   |
| Example: Student records                | Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle                   |

### In short:

* **Database = Data**
* **DBMS = Tool/software to manage that data**

This separation helps ensure **data security, consistency, and efficient access**.
